# cloudservices

This was app to show the status of our cloud services. It's a basic ping test and would alert on status 
change and log the time to a file. It was basic but effective - beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

A Jenkins job would run the python script that would check the urls and update the csstatus.json file.
